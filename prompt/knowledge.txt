// Instruction
Given a math problem, it is overly complicated and lacks clear knowledge for students to grasp. Your task is to summarize the general solving rules to assist students.
Important notes:
1. The rules summarized are general and not tailored to specific questions.
2. The rules summarized should not contain any semantic information from the questions.
3. The rules summarized should map complete reasoning steps for solving the questions.

Use the following format for output:
{
    "output": [
        "<rule1>",
        ...
    ]
}

// Input
<input>
